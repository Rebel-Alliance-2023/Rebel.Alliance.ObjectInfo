ToDo:
As of 11/4, we do know that we will need to release new versions of ObjectInfo and ObjectInfo.Deepdive nuget packages to accomodate the modifications driven by the addition of ObjectInfo.Overlord.

I am adding a new Plugin so I'll wait to rev the other packages.

To Do: The next steps on our agenda are to create the EfCoreSpecificationEmitter and DapperSpecificationEmitter classes to generate the actual specification code.
