# CyclomaticComplexityAnalyzer

The CyclomaticComplexityAnalyzer is a plugin for ObjectInfo.Deepdive that calculates the cyclomatic complexity of methods in a .NET application.

## Key Features

- Implements the `IMethodAnalyzer` interface
- Calculates cyclomatic complexity for individual methods
- Provides interpretation of the calculated complexity

## Implementation Details

The analyzer uses the following technique to parse and interpret the method body:

1. **Method Body Retrieval**: 
   - Uses reflection to find the method in the loaded assemblies
   - Retrieves the method body as a byte array using `MethodBody.GetILAsByteArray()`

2. **Complexity Calculation**:
   - Converts the byte array to a string representation
   - Counts the number of branch instructions (represented by the byte `0x02` in IL)
   - Adds 1 to the count to get the final complexity

## Complexity Interpretation

The analyzer provides the following interpretation of cyclomatic complexity:

- 1-5: Simple, low-risk code
- 6-10: Moderately complex, moderate risk
- 11-20: Complex, high-risk code
- 21+: Untestable code (very high risk)

## Integration with ObjectInfo.Deepdive

- Implements the `IAnalyzerPlugin` interface for easy integration
- Can be loaded dynamically by the PluginLoader

## Limitations

- The current implementation may not capture all nuances of cyclomatic complexity
- Relies on IL code analysis, which may not always accurately represent source code complexity

The CyclomaticComplexityAnalyzer provides valuable insights into method complexity, helping developers identify areas of code that may need refactoring or additional testing.
